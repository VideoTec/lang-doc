第一个例子

void fun(int i) {
  printf("%d", i);
}

int v = 0;
fun(v++);  //printf > 0

A. Pre Decrement Operator
Pre-decrement operator is used to decrement the value of variable before using in the expression. In the Pre-decrement value is first decremented and then used inside the expression.

b = --var;
Suppose the value of variable var is 10 then we can say that value of variable ‘var’ is firstly decremented then updated value will be used in the expression.

B. Post Decrement Operator
Post-decrement operator is used to decrement the value of variable immediatly after executing expression completely in which post decrement is used. In the Post-decrement old value is first used in a expression and then old value will be decrement by 1.

b = var--;

Value of variable ‘var’ is 5. Same value will be used in expression and after execution of expression new value will be 4.
