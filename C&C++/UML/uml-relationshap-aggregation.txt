如何判断两个对象（类）之间是聚合关系？
An aggregation or composition indicates that a whole is made of (physically composed of) its parts.  

A good heuristic test for whether a relationship is a composition relationship is to ask: 
‘if the part moves, can one deduce that the whole moves with it in normal circumstances?’.  

For example, the relationship ‘is the managing director of’ between People and Companies is not a composition 
because if the MD goes on holiday to the Alps, the company does not.  
On the other hand, if his legs go the Alps then the MD probably goes too 
(unless he has seriously upset some unscrupulous business rivals). 

在 c++ 使用引用成员变量，从语法来保证，聚合关系，引用必须在构造时指定。
