为什么malloc时需要指定size，对应的free时不需要指定size？

slightly[英][ˈslaɪtli] [美][ˈslaɪtli]
adv.轻微地，轻轻地；细长地，苗条地；〈罕〉轻蔑地；粗

adjacent[英][əˈdʒeɪsnt] [美][əˈdʒesənt]
adj.邻近的，毗邻的；（时间上）紧接着的；相邻

Q:How does free know how many bytes to free? 
A:
The malloc/free implementation remembers the size of each block as it is allocated, 
so it is not necessary to remind it of the size when freeing. 
(Typically, the size is stored adjacent to the allocated block, which is why things usually break badly if the bounds of the allocated block are even slightly overstepped; see also question 7.19.)
