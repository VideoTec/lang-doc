fopen r/rb 文件结束符的区别 substitute  SOFT EOF
----------------------------
in text mode, it inserts a special character 26(1a) at the end of the file as a mark. 

In CP/M, 86-DOS, MS-DOS, PC DOS, DR-DOS and their various derivatives, 
character 26 was also used to indicate the end of a character stream, 
and thereby used to terminate user input in an interactive command line window 
(and as such, often used to finish console input redirection, e.g. as instigated by COPY CON: TYPEDTXT.TXT)

it is often termed a "soft" EOF, 
as it does not necessarily represent the physical end of the file but more a marker that 
"there is no useful data beyond this point". 

Many file format standards (e.g. PNG or GIF) include character 26 in their headers to perform precisely this function. 
Some modern text file formats (e.g. CSV-1203[5]) still recommend a trailing EOF character to be inserted as the last character in the file

Some programming languages (e.g. VisualBasic) will not read past SOFT EOF when using the built-in text file reading primitives (INPUT, LINE INPUT etc.) and 
alternate methods must be adopted e.g. opening as BINARY or using the File System Object to progress beyond it.

CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on input
Control+Z is a control character in ASCII code. It is commonly used as a substitute (SUB) character.
It is also used to signal an end-of-file on some operating systems.
