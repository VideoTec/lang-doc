#define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */

       int asprintf(char **strp, const char *fmt, ...);
       int vasprintf(char **strp, const char *fmt, va_list ap);

The functions asprintf() and vasprintf() are analogs of sprintf(3)
and vsprintf(3), except that they allocate a string large enough to
hold the output including the terminating null byte ('\0'), and
return a pointer to it via the first argument.  This pointer should
be passed to free(3) to release the allocated storage when it is no
longer needed.
