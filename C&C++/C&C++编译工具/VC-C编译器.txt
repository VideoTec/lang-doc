Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 18.00.21005.

注意下面的代码：
  ptr = strrchr(response_buffer, '\n');
  if (ptr - response_buffer != (len - 1)) {
    return 0;
  }
  const char *last_line_ptr = response_buffer;
如果if语句，不加大括号，后面的声明语句，会出错。

In C89 and earlier, all block-scope variable declarations must come before any statements. 
C99 changed this rule, so that declarations and statements may be intermixed as in C++.

Unfortunately, Microsoft has chosen not to support C99 in Visual Studio and has no plans to AFAIK.

it appears that cl.exe does NOT support C99, which is incredible. It's been almost 10 years!
