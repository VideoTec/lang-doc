`r'
Insert the files member... into archive (with replacement). 
This operation differs from `q' in that any previously existing members are deleted if their names match those being added.
If one of the files named in member... does not exist, ar displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any existing members of the archive matching that name.

By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you may use one of the modifiers `a', `b', or `i' to request placement relative to some existing member.

The modifier `v' used with this operation elicits a line of output for each file inserted, 
along with one of the letters `a' or `r' to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member deleted) or replaced.
