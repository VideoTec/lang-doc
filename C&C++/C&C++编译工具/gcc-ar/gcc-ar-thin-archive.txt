a thin archive, which contains a symbol index and references to the original copies of the member files of the archive

意思是： .a文件里，只是.o文件的引用？
This is useful for building libraries for use within a local build tree, where the relocatable objects are expected to remain available, and copying the contents of each object would only waste time and space

When linking a static library as a thin archive the .o-files are not copied into the archive, but rather they are referenced with their relative path from the .a file.

How can I check if a given .a file is a thin archive or not?
head -1 t.a 
!<thin>
