g++ and gcc are drivers. Usually, they run the 
preprocessor (cpp), 
compiler proper (cc1plus for C++ and cc1 for C) and 
the linker (gold or GNU ld) and 
all other things necessary. 
The difference between gcc and g++ is that the latter includes one additional library to link against (libstdc++).
