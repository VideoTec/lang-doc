What is “strip” (GCC application) used for?
strip removes or modifies the symbol table attached to the output of the assembler and link editor. 
This is useful to save space after a program has been debugged and to limit dynamically bound symbols.

With Visual C++ (and other Microsoft compilers) on Windows, symbols aren't part of the binaries. 
Instead, they are stored in separate files called "Program Database" files (.pdb files). 
Just don't provide the .pdb files.

With the GNU toolchain you would use strip to remove symbols from the binaries
