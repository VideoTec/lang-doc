Date and Time Datatype

SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. 
Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values:

TEXT 
as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS").

REAL 
as Julian day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. 
according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

INTEGER as Unix Time, 
the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

Applications can chose to store dates and times in any of these formats and freely convert 
between formats using the built-in date and time functions.
