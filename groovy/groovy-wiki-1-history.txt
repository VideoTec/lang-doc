James Strachan first talked about the development of Groovy on his blog in August 2003.[5] 
Several versions were released between 2004 and 2006. 

After the Java Community Process (JCP) standardization process began, 
the version numbering changed and a version called "1.0" was released on January 2, 2007. 
After various betas and release candidates numbered 1.1, on December 7, 2007, 
Groovy 1.1 Final was released and immediately rebranded 
as Groovy 1.5 as a reflection of the many changes made.

In 2007, Groovy won the first prize at JAX 2007 innovation award.[6] 
In 2008, Grails, a Groovy web framework, won the second prize at JAX 2008 innovation award.[7]

In November 2008, SpringSource acquired the Groovy and Grails company (G2One).[8] 
In August 2009 VMWare acquired SpringSource.[9]

Strachan had left the project silently a year before the Groovy 1.0 release in 2007.[citation needed] 
In July 2009, Strachan wrote on his blog, 
"I can honestly say if someone had shown me the Programming in Scala book 
by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon & Bill Venners back in 2003 I'd probably have never created Groovy.".[10] 

In Oct 2016, Strachan's views had changed as he stated 
"I still love groovy (jenkins pipelines are so groovy!), java, go, typescript and kotlin. 
I don’t use scala any more".[11]

解释：
Scala（发音为/ˈskɑːlə, ˈskeɪlə/）是一门多范式的编程语言，
设计初衷是要整合面向对象编程和函数式编程的各种特性

In March 2004, 
Groovy had been submitted to the JCP as JSR 241[12] and accepted by ballot. 
After 8 years of inactivity, 
the Spec Lead changed its status to dormant in April 2012.

On July 2, 2012, 
Groovy 2.0 was released, which, among other new features, 
added static compilation and a static type checker to Groovy.

When the Pivotal joint venture was spun-off by EMC and VMware in April 2013, 
Groovy and Grails formed part of its product portfolio. 
Pivotal ceased sponsoring Groovy and Grails from April 2015.[3] 

That same month, 
Groovy changed its governance structure from a Codehaus repository 
to a Project Management Committee (PMC) in the Apache Software Foundation via its incubator.[4] 
Groovy graduated from Apache's incubator and become a top-level project in November 2015
