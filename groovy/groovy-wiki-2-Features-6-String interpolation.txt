String interpolation[edit]
In Groovy we can interpolate the string with variables and expressions by using GStrings:[31]

···
BigDecimal account = 10.0
def text = "Your account shows currently a balance of $account"
assert text == "Your account shows currently a balance of 10.0"
···

GStrings containing variables and expressions must be declared using double quotes.

A complex expression must be enclosed in curly brackets. 
This prevents parts of it from being interpreted as belonging to the surrounding string instead of to the expression:

···
BigDecimal minus = 4.0
text = "Your account shows currently a balance of ${account - minus}"
assert text == "Your account shows currently a balance of 6.0"

// Without the brackets to isolate the expression, we would have the following:
text = "Your account shows currently a balance of $account - minus"
assert text == "Your account shows currently a balance of 10.0 - minus"
···

Expression evaluation can be deferred by employing arrow syntax:

···
BigDecimal tax = 0.15
text = "Your account shows currently a balance of ${->account - account * tax}"
tax = 0.10

// The tax value was changed AFTER declaration of the GString. The expression 
// variables are bound only when the expression must actually be evaluated:

assert text == "Your account shows currently a balance of 9.000"
···
