Apache Groovy is an object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. 
It is a dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, Perl, and Smalltalk. 

It can be used as a scripting language for the Java Platform, 
is dynamically compiled to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode, 
and interoperates with other Java code and libraries. 

Groovy uses a Java-like curly-bracket syntax. 
Most Java code is also syntactically valid Groovy, 
although semantics may be different.

Groovy 1.0 was released on January 2, 2007, and 

Groovy 2.0 in July, 2012. 
Since version 2, Groovy can also be compiled statically, 
offering type inference and performance very close to that of Java.[1][2] 

Groovy 2.4 was the last major release under Pivotal Software's sponsorship which ended in March 2015.[3] 
Groovy has since changed its governance structure 
to a Project Management Committee (PMC) in the Apache Software Foundation.
