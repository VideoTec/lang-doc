Section 11.9.4   The Strict Equals Operator ( === )

The production EqualityExpression : EqualityExpression === RelationalExpression
is evaluated as follows: 
- Let lref be the result of evaluating EqualityExpression.
- Let lval be GetValue(lref).
- Let rref be the result of evaluating RelationalExpression.
- Let rval be GetValue(rref).
- Return the result of performing the strict equality comparison 
  rval === lval. (See 11.9.6)
  
11.9.6   The Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm

The comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces true or false. 
Such a comparison is performed as follows: 
- If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return false.
- If Type(x) is Undefined, return true.
- If Type(x) is Null, return true.
- If Type(x) is Number, then
...
- If Type(x) is String, then return true if x and y are exactly the 
  same sequence of characters (same length and same characters in 
  corresponding positions); otherwise, return false.
