That's not JSON. 
It's just Javascript objects, and has nothing at all to do with JSON.

var obj = { name : value, anotherName : anotherValue };

Modern browsers (IE8, FF3, Chrome etc.) 
have native JSON support built in (Same API as with JSON2).

So as long you're not dealing with IE6/7 
you can do it just as easily as that:

var j={"name":"binchen"};
JSON.stringify(j); // '{"name":"binchen"}'

That's not JSON. 
It's just Javascript objects, and has nothing at all to do with JSON.

You can use brackets to set the properties dynamically. Example:

var obj = {};
obj['name'] = value;
obj['anotherName'] = anotherValue;
This gives exactly the same as creating the object with an object literal like this:

var obj = { name : value, anotherName : anotherValue };

ips[ipId] = {}; 【定义子对象】
ips[ipId]['name'] = value;
ips[ipId]['anotherName'] = anotherValue;
