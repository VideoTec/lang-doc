Until you fully understand the differences and 
implications of using the == and === operators, 
use the === operator since it will save you from obscure (non-obvious) bugs and WTFs. 
The "regular" == operator can have very unexpected results due to the type-coercion internally, 
so using === is always the recommended approach

To boil down a whole lot of details to a few simple takeaways, 
and help you know whether to use == or === in various situations, 
here are my simple rules:

1) If either value (aka side) in a comparison could be the true or false value, 
avoid == and use ===.

2) If either value in a comparison 
could be of these specific values (0, "", or [] -- empty array), 
avoid == and use ===.

3) In all other cases, you're safe to use ==. 
Not only is it safe, 
but in many cases it simplifies your code in a way that improves readability.
