Note that JavaScript distinguishes between 
String objects and 
primitive string values.

String literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings 
returned from String calls in a non-constructor context 
(i.e., without using the new keyword) are primitive strings. 

JavaScript automatically converts primitives to String objects, 
so that it's possible to use String object methods for primitive strings. 
In contexts where a method is to be invoked on a primitive string or a property lookup occurs, 
JavaScript will automatically wrap the string primitive and call the method or perform the property lookup.

对原始字符串和 String 对象的区分

var s_prim = "foo";
var s_obj = new String(s_prim);

console.log(typeof s_prim); // Logs "string"
console.log(typeof s_obj);  // Logs "object"
