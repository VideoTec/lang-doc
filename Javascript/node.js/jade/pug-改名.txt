Rename from "Jade"

This project was formerly known as "Jade." 
However, it has been revealed to us that "Jade" is a registered trademark, 
and as a result a rename is needed. 

After some discussion among the maintainers, 
"Pug" has been chosen as the new name for this project. 
The next major version will carry "pug" as the package name.

If your package or app currently uses jade, don't worry: 
we have secured permissions to continue to occupy that package name, 
although all new versions will be released under pug.

Before the renaming, 
we had already begun working on an incompatible Jade 2.0.0. 

We have then made it so that this new major version bump 
will coincide with the rename to Pug. 
Therefore, upgrading from Jade to Pug will be the same process 
as upgrading any other package with a major version bump. 

Currently, 
Pug 2.0.0 is still under beta stage, 
and there are several syntactic differences we have deprecated and removed. 
Such differences are documented at #2305.

The website and documentation for Pug are still being updated, 
but if you are new to Pug, 
you should get started with the new syntax and install the Pug package on npm.
