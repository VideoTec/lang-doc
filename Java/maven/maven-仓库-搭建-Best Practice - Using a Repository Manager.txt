A repository manager is a dedicated server application 
designed to manage repositories of binary components. 
The usage of a repository manager 
is considered an essential best practice for any significant usage of Maven.

1）act as dedicated proxy server for public Maven repositories
2）provide repositories as a deployment destination for your Maven project outputs

Using a repository manager provides the following benefits and features:

1）significantly reduced number of downloads off remote repositories, 
saving time and bandwidth resulting in increased build performance

2）improved build stability 
due to reduced reliance on external repositories

3）increased performance 
for interaction with remote SNAPSHOT repositories

4）potential for control of consumed and provided artifacts

5）creates a central storage and access to artifacts and 
meta data about them exposing build outputs to consumer 
such as other projects and developers, 
but also QA or operations teams or even customers

6）provides an effective platform for 
exchanging binary artifacts within your organization 
and beyond without the need for building artifact from source
