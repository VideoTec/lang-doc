Whether you choose to install Archiva 
as a standalone application or 
as a web application in your preferred Java EE application server, 
only a minimal amount of configuration is necessary.

第一种安装方法：
Installing as a Service on Windows

On Windows, to use the start and stop commands 
you must first install it as a service. 
This is done by running:

.\bin\archiva.bat install
安装的服务执行的命令：
D:\tools\apache-archiva-2.2.1\bin\wrapper-windows-x86-64.exe -s D:\tools\apache-archiva-2.2.1\conf\wrapper.conf
安装完后：
http://localhost:8080/
http://localhost:8080/repository/internal/

You can then use the start and stop commands 
as well as the traditional Windows service management console to manage the Archiva service.

This procedure installs the service to run as the local system user. 
You must ensure that it has access to read the installation, 
and to write to the logs and data directories.

Note on last Windows version, 
you need to configure correctly path to your java executable. 
In wrapper.conf file:

wrapper.java.command=fullpath to your java executable

You can later remove the service with:

.\bin\archiva.bat remove

第二种安装方法：

ArchivaS is referred to as a "Build Artifact Repository Manager". 
It is basically a web application 
that provides useful functionality in conjunction with mavenSW repositories. 

One of the great things that it can do it serve 
as an on-demand mirror of the maven central repository. 

Rather than making requests for artifacts from the maven central repository, 
you ask the Archiva 'repository' for the central repository artifact. 

Archiva will then retrieve the artifact and accompanying metadata files 
from the maven central repository and store these files in its repository, 
and it will return the requested artifact to the user. 

If another developer makes a request of Archiva for the same artifact, 
Archiva will return the artifact to the user. 

Archiva doesn't need to make a request to the central repository 
since it already has the resource. 

Thus, it can provide "on-demand" mirroring capabilities of the maven central repository. 
It's a great way to minimize long-distance network communication and 
replace it with an in-house repository mirror server 
that only mirrors the artifacts that your team is using.
