Maven repositories

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven

Maven dynamically downloads Java libraries and Maven plug-ins 
from one or more repositories such as the Maven 2 Central Repository, 
and stores them in a local cache.[4] 
This local cache of downloaded artifacts can also be updated with artifacts created by local projects. 
Public repositories can also be updated.

Alternative technologies like gradle and sbt as build tools do not rely on XML, 
but keep the key concepts Maven introduced. 
With Apache Ivy, a dedicated dependency manager was developed as well 
that also supports Maven repositories

Maven 2 Central Repository[4] is used by default to search for libraries, 
but one can configure the repositories to be used (e.g., company-private repositories) within the POM.
