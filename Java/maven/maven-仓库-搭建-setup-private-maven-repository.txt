Yesterday I got a question: 
"In the end, there will be ton of library modules placed inside the android project. 
What is the best and sustainable way to organize these libraries for both current and future uses?".

Well, I think the question was quite great and 
I believe that many of you might have the same doubtfulness in mind so 
I decide to write this blog giving you an instruction 
how to "setup your own Private Maven Repository" for the internal use.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Why should we setup a Private Maven Repository?
-------------------------------------------------------------

It's true that an Android Library module 
is actually just a bunch of source codes grouped in the same directory. 
If you want to let other developers use your library, 
you could simply send them the whole directory and let them include it in their project.

Alright, I will give you an instruction 
how to set up our own Private Maven Repository as a dedicated server. 

The open source software I choose is Artifactory 
since it is incredibly easy to install despite its countless promising features and its stability.
