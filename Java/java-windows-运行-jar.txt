I have a "helloworld.jar" file. For running a JAR file I am using a command-line window and executing the following command:

    java -jar helloworld.jar

By using this command I can execute the JAR file. But instead of doing it in a command-line window, I want to execute the JAR file if I double click on the JAR file. I did some Google search for this. But I cannot do this.

For this do I need to install any software? Can any one provide me help on this?
