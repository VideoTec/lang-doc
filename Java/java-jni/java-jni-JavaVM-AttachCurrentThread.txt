     * They're usually started from managed code (using Thread.start), but they can also be created elsewhere and then
     * attached to the JavaVM. For example, a thread started with pthread_create can be attached with the
     * JNI AttachCurrentThread or AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon functions. Until a thread is attached, it has no JNIEnv,
     * and cannot make JNI calls.
     * Attaching a natively-created thread causes a java.lang.Thread object to be constructed and added to the "main"
     * ThreadGroup, making it visible to the debugger. Calling AttachCurrentThread on an already-attached thread
     * is a no-op.
     * Note: You can call this function any number of times for the same thread, there's no harm in it

     * in Android 2.0 (Eclair) and higher you can use pthread_key_create to define a destructor function that will be
     * called before the thread exits, and call DetachCurrentThread from there. (Use that key with pthread_setspecific
     * to store the JNIEnv in thread-local-storage; that way it'll be passed into your destructor as the argument.)
     * Note: The destructor is not called unless the stored value is != NULL
