jfieldID GetFieldID(JNIEnv *env, jclass clazz, const char *name, const char *sig);

Returns the field ID for an instance (nonstatic) field of a class. The field is specified by its name and signature. The Get<type>Field and Set<type>Field families of accessor functions use field IDs to retrieve object fields.

GetFieldID() causes an uninitialized class to be initialized.

GetFieldID() cannot be used to obtain the length field of an array. Use GetArrayLength() instead.
