The JNI function NewDirectByteBuffer always returns a big-endian byte buffer in
order to be consistent with the java.nio.ByteBuffer API, which also always
creates new buffers with big-endian order.  Changing this behavior now has the
potential to break existing, working code, so we won't do that.

We could add a new JNI function, say NewDirectByteBufferOfNativeOrder, but
since the workaround is so trivial it's not clear that doing so would be
worthwhile.
