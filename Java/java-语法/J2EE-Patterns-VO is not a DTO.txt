A value object is not a DTO. 
The two terms have been conflated by Java developers in the past

So, for many people, 
DTOs and VOs are the same thing 
(but Fowler uses VOs to mean something else as we saw). 
Most of time, 
they follow the JavaBeans conventions and are thus JavaBeans too. 
And all are POJOs.

Early J2EE literature used the term value object 
to describe a different notion, 
what I call a Data Transfer Object. 

They have since changed their usage and 
use the term Transfer Object instead.
