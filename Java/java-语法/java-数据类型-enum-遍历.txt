Java enum for loop discussion
As you can see in the example, the Java enum for loop code looks like this:

for (Day d: Day.values())
{
  System.out.println(d);
}
This is a standard Java 5 for loop, with the only here being the use of the values method of our Java enum. This values method returns an enum array -- in this case an enum array of type Day (Day[]) -- that our Java 5 for loop can iterate through.

As you might guess from looking at the code -- and knowing that the values method returns an enum array -- the output from the test enum class is:

SUNDAY
MONDAY
TUESDAY
WEDNESDAY
THURSDAY
FRIDAY
SATURDAY
