The EJB Architecture

EJBs are based conceptually on the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) model. For example, remote object access and parameter passing for EJBs follow the RMI specification.

The EJB specification does not prescribe that the transport mechanism has to be pure RMI. The Oracle8i EJB server uses RMI over IIOP for its transport protocol, a practice that is becoming common among server vendors.
