You can have a static class variable, 
which will be preserved across all instances of the class. 
If that's what you want. If not, use an instance variable, 
which will only be preserved across method calls on this object.

public class Foo {
   static int bar;
   //set bar somewhere

   public int baz() {
      return 3 * bar;
   }
}
