In Java, when you call the toString() method of an object that hasn't overridden it, 
it prints out strings that look like these:

Object@3e25a5
Car@19821f

Many people believe that this is the memory location of the object, 
but it's not quite. 
It is, however, a string that seems unique to an object, 
so the confusion seems understandable.
