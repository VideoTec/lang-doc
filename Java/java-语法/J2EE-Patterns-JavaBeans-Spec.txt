JavaBeans Spec

The JavaBeans 1.01 specification is now available. 
This describes JavaBeans since they were introduced in JDK. 
This minor revision fixes some errors 
and omissions in the JavaBeans 1.00-A spec, 
adds some clarifications, 
and defines some extra (optional) conventions. 

See the change history for details.
