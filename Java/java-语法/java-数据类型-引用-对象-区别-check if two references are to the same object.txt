Let's say that you have overridden an object's equals() and hashCode() methods, 
so that they use the object's fields.

How you do you check if two references are to the same object, 
ala the stock equals() method?

使用相等操作符判断

Use == on objects to perform identity comparison.

That is what the default implementation of equals() does, 
but one normally overrides equals() to serve as an "equivalent content" check.
