The ordering of the members of a class 
can have a great effect on learnability, 
but there is no single correct recipe for how to do it. 
Different classes may order their members differently.

What is important is that 
each class order its members in some logical order, 
which its maintainer could explain if asked. 

chronological[英][ˌkrɒnəˈlɒdʒɪkl] [美][ˌkrɑ:nəˈlɑ:dʒɪkl]
adj.按时间的前后顺序排列的；编年的

habitually[英][hə'bɪtʃʊəlɪ] [美][həˈbɪtʃʊəlɪ]
adv.习惯地，惯常地；素；素常

For example, 
new methods are not just habitually added to the end of the class, 
as that would yield "chronological by date added" ordering, 
which is not a logical ordering.

Overloads: never split - 重载方法要放在一起

When a class has 
multiple constructors, or 
multiple methods with the same name, 
these appear sequentially, with no intervening members.
