An Instant is a point on notional a global time-line, 
regardless of calendar system and time zone. 

It's simply a number of "ticks" since some arbitrary epoch, 
where a tick in Noda Time is 100 nanoseconds 
(a definition inherited from the BCL). 

Noda Time always uses the Unix epoch, 
which corresponds to midnight on January 1st 1970 UTC. 

(This is merely one way of expressing the epoch - 
it would be equally valid to express it using other calendar systems and time zones; 
the epoch itself has no notion of a time zone or calendar system.)

Using the .NET framework's DateTime structure
The .NET framework uses the DateTime structure to represent an instant in time. 
In the DateTime structure, time values are measured in 100-nanosecond units called ticks. 
To load data created with the DateTime structure into the MDEX Engine, 
you must convert from ticks to nanoseconds, 
and then from nanoseconds to milliseconds. 
Conversely, to work with data returned from the MDEX Engine using the DateTime structure, 
you must convert it from milliseconds to nanoseconds, 
and then from nanoseconds to ticks.

The conversions work as follows:

1 second = 1,000 milliseconds

1 second = 1,000,000,000 nanoseconds

1,000 milliseconds = 1,000,000,000 nanoseconds

1 millisecond = 1,000,000 nanoseconds

1,000,000 nanoseconds * (1 tick / 100 nanoseconds) = 10,000 ticks

10,000 ticks = 1 millisecond
