Class Overview

Patterns are compiled regular expressions. In many cases, convenience methods such as String.matches, String.replaceAll and String.split will be preferable, but if you need to do a lot of work with the same regular expression, it may be more efficient to compile it once and reuse it. The Pattern class and its companion, Matcher, also offer more functionality than the small amount exposed by String.

 // String convenience methods:
 boolean sawFailures = s.matches("Failures: \\d+");
 String farewell = s.replaceAll("Hello, (\\S+)", "Goodbye, $1");
 String[] fields = s.split(":");

 // Direct use of Pattern:
 Pattern p = Pattern.compile("Hello, (\\S+)");
 Matcher m = p.matcher(inputString);
 while (m.find()) { // Find each match in turn; String can't do this.
     String name = m.group(1); // Access a submatch group; String can't do this.
 }
