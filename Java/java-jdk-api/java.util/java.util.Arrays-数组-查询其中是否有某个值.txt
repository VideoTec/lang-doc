Arrays.asList(yourArray).contains(yourValue)
Warning: this doesn't work for arrays of primitives (see the comments).

Since java-8

You can now use a Stream to check 
whether an array of int, double or long contains a value 
(by respectively using a IntStream, DoubleStream or LongStream)

Example

int[] a = {1,2,3,4};
boolean contains = IntStream.of(a).anyMatch(x -> x == 4);
