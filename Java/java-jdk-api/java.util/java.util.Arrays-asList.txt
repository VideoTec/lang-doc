@SafeVarargs
public static <T> List<T> asList(T... a)

Returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array. 
(Changes to the returned list "write through" to the array.) 
This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs, 
in combination with Collection.toArray(). 
The returned list is serializable and implements RandomAccess.

This method also provides a convenient way 
to create a fixed-size list initialized to contain several elements:

     List<String> stooges = Arrays.asList("Larry", "Moe", "Curly");
 
Parameters:
a - the array by which the list will be backed

Returns:
a list view of the specified array

asList 限制 - 返回的 list 不能修改

And to make it be an actual list 
(that can be modified, see limitations of Arrays.asList()) 
then just do the following:

List<MyClass> mcList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(mcArray));
