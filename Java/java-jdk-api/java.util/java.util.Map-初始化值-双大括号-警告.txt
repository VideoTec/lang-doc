ArrayList<Object> arrayList = new ArrayList<Object>(){{add(new Object());}}; 

这样初始化有一个警告：
The serializable class does not declare a static final serialVersionUID field of type long

产生的原因：

When you create your anonymous class, 
you are actually extending ArrayList and therefore, 
inheriting the Serializable interface.

All Serializable classes are supposed to have a serialVersionUID 
so that you can distinguish between different serialized versions of the classes. 
Since the anonymous type is a new class, 
it would be a good idea to give it an ID 
so you can distinguish between different versions of it.

Changing when it shouldn't may happen 
for reasons other than class layout changes - 
the problem is that it's compiler implementation dependent. 
If you do debug with Eclipse but do production builds with javac, 
you may end up with two incompatible sets of data.
