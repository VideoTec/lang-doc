Class Overview
-------------------------------------

ArrayList is an implementation of List, backed by an array. 
All optional operations including adding, removing, and replacing elements are supported.

All elements are permitted, including null.

This class is a good choice as your default List implementation. 
Vector synchronizes all operations, 
but not necessarily in a way that's meaningful to your application: 
synchronizing each call to get, for example, 
is not equivalent to synchronizing the list and iterating over it (which is probably what you intended). 
CopyOnWriteArrayList is intended for the special case of very high concurrency, 
frequent traversals, and very rare mutations.

ArrayList 是一个数组队列，相当于动态数组。
它由数组实现，随机访问效率高，随机插入、随机删除效率低
