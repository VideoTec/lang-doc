List has the method add(int, E), so you can use:

list.add(0, yourObject);

Afterwards you can delete the last element with:

if(list.size() > 10)
    list.remove(list.size() - 1);
    
However, you might want to rethink your requirements or use a different data structure, like a Queue

EDIT

Maybe have a look at Apache's CircularFifoBuffer:

CircularFifoBuffer is a first in first out buffer with a fixed size that replaces its oldest element if full.
Just initialize it with you maximum size:

Buffer buffer = new CircularFifoBuffer(10);
NB: As of Common-Collections 4, CircularFifoBuffer is now CircularFifoQueue
