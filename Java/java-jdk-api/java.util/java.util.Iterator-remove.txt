void remove()
Removes from the underlying collection the last element 
returned by this iterator (optional operation). 
This method can be called only once per call to next(). 
The behavior of an iterator is unspecified 
if the underlying collection is modified 
while the iteration is in progress in any way other than by calling this method.

Throws:

UnsupportedOperationException - 
if the remove operation is not supported by this iterator

IllegalStateException - 
if the next method has not yet been called, 
or the remove method has already been called after the last call to the next method
