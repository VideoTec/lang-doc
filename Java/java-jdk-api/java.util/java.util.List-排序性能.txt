Up to Java 7, 
it made no difference because Collections.sort 
would dump the content of the list into an array.

With Java 8, 
using an ArrayList should be slightly faster because Collections.sort 
will call List.sort and ArrayList 
has a specialised version that sorts the backing array directly, saving a copy.

So bottom line is ArrayList 
is better as it gives a similar or better performance 
depending on the version of Java.
