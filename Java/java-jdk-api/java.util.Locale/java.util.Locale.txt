Locale represents a language/country/variant combination. 
Locales are used to alter the presentation of information 
such as numbers or dates to suit the conventions in the region they describe.

The language codes are two-letter lowercase ISO language codes (such as "en") 
as defined by ISO 639-1. 
The country codes are two-letter uppercase ISO country codes (such as "US") 
as defined by ISO 3166-1. The variant codes are unspecified.

Note that Java uses several deprecated two-letter codes. 
The Hebrew ("he") language code is rewritten as "iw", Indonesian ("id") as "in", 
and Yiddish ("yi") as "ji". 

This rewriting happens even if you construct your own Locale object, 
not just for instances returned by the various lookup methods.
