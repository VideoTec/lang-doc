Read the response. 
Response headers typically include metadata 
such as the response body's content type and length, modified dates and session cookies. 
The response body may be read from the stream returned by getInputStream(). 
If the response has no body, 
that method returns an empty stream.

For example, to retrieve the webpage at http://www.android.com/:

   URL url = new URL("http://www.android.com/");
   HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
   try {
     InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
     readStream(in);
   } finally {
     urlConnection.disconnect();
   }
