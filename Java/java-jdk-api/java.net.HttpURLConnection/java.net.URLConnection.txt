Class Overview

A connection to a URL for reading or writing. 
For HTTP connections, 
see HttpURLConnection for documentation of HTTP-specific features.

For example, to retrieve ftp://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/index.html:

   URL url = new URL("ftp://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/index.html");
   URLConnection urlConnection = url.openConnection();
   InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
   try {
     readStream(in);
    finally {
     in.close();
   }
 }
 
URLConnection must be configured before it has connected to the remote resource. 
Instances of URLConnection are not reusable: 
you must use a different instance for each connection to a resource
