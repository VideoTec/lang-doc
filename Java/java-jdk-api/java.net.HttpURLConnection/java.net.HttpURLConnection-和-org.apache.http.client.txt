Apache HTTP client has fewer bugs on Eclair and Froyo. It is the best choice for these releases.

For Gingerbread and better, HttpURLConnection is the best choice. 
Its simple API and small size makes it great fit for Android. 
Transparent compression and response caching reduce network use, 
improve speed and save battery. 
New applications should use HttpURLConnection; 
it is where we will be spending our energy going forward.
