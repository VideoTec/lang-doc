HttpURLConnection#getErrorStream() returns null when receiving a 401 or 407, 
not because the noop implementation in the abstract class,
but because HttpURLConnection closes/clears the connection immediately 
if it sees a 401/407 when in streaming mode(i.e., POST). 

 If the connection was not connected, or if the server did not have an error while connecting or 
 if the server had an error but no error data was sent, this method will return null.
 
示例：读取 http 错误信息
    int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();
    InputStream is = connection.getErrorStream();
    String errorMsg = "IOException";
    if (is != null) {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int len = is.read(buffer);
        if (len < 1024) {
            errorMsg = new String(buffer, 0, len, "UTF8");
        }
    }
