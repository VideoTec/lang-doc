public void loadLibrary (String nickname)

Added in API level 1
Loads a shared library. Class loaders have some influence over this process, but for a typical Android app, it works as follows:

Given the name "MyLibrary", that string will be passed to mapLibraryName(String). That means it would be a mistake for the caller to include the usual "lib" prefix and ".so" suffix.

That file will then be searched for on the application's native library search path. This consists of the application's own native library directory followed by the system's native library directories.

Throws
UnsatisfiedLinkError	if the library can not be loaded, either because it's not found or because there is something wrong with it.
