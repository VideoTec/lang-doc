public final Class<?> getClass ()

Added in API level 1
Returns the unique instance of Class that represents this object's class. Note that getClass() is a special case in that it actually returns Class where Foo is the erasure of the type of the expression getClass() was called upon.

As an example, the following code actually compiles, although one might think it shouldn't:

List l = new ArrayList();
Class c = l.getClass();

Returns
this object's Class instance.
