it's possible to reorder arguments so that 
they appear in a different order in the output than the order in which they were supplied. 
For example, "%4$s" formats the fourth argument (4$) as a string (s).
 
It's also possible to reuse an argument with <. 
For example, format("%o %<d %<x", 64) results in "100 64 40"
