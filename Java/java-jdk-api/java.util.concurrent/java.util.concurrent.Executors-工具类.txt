Class Overview

Factory and utility methods for 
1） Executor, 
2） ExecutorService, 
3） ScheduledExecutorService, 
3） ThreadFactory, and Callable classes defined in this package. 

This class supports the following kinds of methods:

1）Methods that create and return an ExecutorService set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
2）Methods that create and return a ScheduledExecutorService set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
3）Methods that create and return a "wrapped" ExecutorService, that disables reconfiguration by making implementation-specific methods inaccessible.
4）Methods that create and return a ThreadFactory that sets newly created threads to a known state.
5）Methods that create and return a Callable out of other closure-like forms, so they can be used in execution methods requiring Callable.
