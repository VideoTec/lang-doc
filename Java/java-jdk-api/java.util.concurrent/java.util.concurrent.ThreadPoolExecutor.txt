An ExecutorService that executes each submitted task 
using one of possibly several pooled threads, 
normally configured using Executors factory methods.

Thread pools address two different problems: 
they usually provide improved performance when executing large numbers of asynchronous tasks, 
due to reduced per-task invocation overhead, 
and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources, 
including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks. 
Each ThreadPoolExecutor also maintains some basic statistics, 
such as the number of completed tasks.
