A cancellable asynchronous computation. 
This class provides a base implementation of Future, 
with methods to start and cancel a computation, 
query to see if the computation is complete, 
and retrieve the result of the computation. 
The result can only be retrieved when the computation has completed; 
the get methods will block if the computation has not yet completed. 
Once the computation has completed, 
the computation cannot be restarted or cancelled 
(unless the computation is invoked using runAndReset()).

A FutureTask can be used to wrap a Callable or Runnable object. 
Because FutureTask implements Runnable, 
a FutureTask can be submitted to an Executor for execution.

In addition to serving as a standalone class, 
this class provides protected functionality that may be useful 
when creating customized task classes.
