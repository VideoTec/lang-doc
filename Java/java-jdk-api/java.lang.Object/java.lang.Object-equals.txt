     * Compares this instance with the specified object and indicates if they
     * are equal. In order to be equal, {@code o} must represent the same object
     * as this instance using a class-specific comparison. The general contract
     * is that this comparison should be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
     * Also, no object reference other than null is equal to null.
     *
     * <p>The default implementation returns {@code true} only if {@code this ==
     * o}. See <a href="{@docRoot}reference/java/lang/Object.html#writing_equals">Writing a correct
     * {@code equals} method</a>
     * if you intend implementing your own {@code equals} method.
     *
     * <p>The general contract for the {@code equals} and {@link
     * #hashCode()} methods is that if {@code equals} returns {@code true} for
     * any two objects, then {@code hashCode()} must return the same value for
     * these objects. This means that subclasses of {@code Object} usually
     * override either both methods or neither of them.
     *
     * @param o
     *            the object to compare this instance with.
     * @return {@code true} if the specified object is equal to this {@code
     *         Object}; {@code false} otherwise.
     * @see #hashCode
