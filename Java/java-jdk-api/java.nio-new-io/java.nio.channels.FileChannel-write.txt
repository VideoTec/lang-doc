public abstract int write (ByteBuffer src)

Writes bytes from the given byte buffer to this file channel.

The bytes are written starting at the current file position, 
and after some number of bytes are written (up to the remaining number of bytes in the buffer) 
the file position is increased by the number of bytes actually written.

Parameters
src	the byte buffer containing the bytes to be written.

Returns
the number of bytes actually written.

Throws
NonWritableChannelException	if the channel was not opened for writing.
ClosedChannelException	if the channel was already closed.
AsynchronousCloseException	if another thread closes the channel during the write.
ClosedByInterruptException	if another thread interrupts the calling thread while this operation is in progress. 
                            The interrupt state of the calling thread is set and the channel is closed.
