public abstract int read (ByteBuffer buffer)

Reads bytes from this file channel into the given buffer.

The maximum number of bytes that will be read is the remaining number of bytes in the buffer when the method is invoked. 
The bytes will be copied into the buffer starting at the buffer's current position.

The call may block if other threads are also attempting to read from this channel.

Upon completion, the buffer's position is set to the end of the bytes that have been read. 
The buffer's limit is not changed.

Parameters
buffer	the byte buffer to receive the bytes.

Returns
the number of bytes actually read.

Throws
AsynchronousCloseException	if another thread closes the channel during the read.
ClosedByInterruptException	if another thread interrupts the calling thread during the read.
ClosedChannelException	if this channel is closed.
IOException	if another I/O error occurs, details are in the message.
NonReadableChannelException	if the channel has not been opened in a mode that permits reading
