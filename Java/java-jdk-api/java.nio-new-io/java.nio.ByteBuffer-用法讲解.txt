In my experience, java.nio.ByteBuffer 
is a source of confusion and subtle bugs when developers first encounter it, 
because it is not immediately obvious how to use it correctly. 

It took some repeated reading of the API docs and some experience to realize some subtleties, 
before I felt comfortable with them. 

This post is a short crash in how to use them correctly, to hopefully save others some trouble.
