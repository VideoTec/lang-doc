Android does not offer all classes that "conventional java" has to offer. 
Files is one of the classes, that Android doesn't offer.

You can have a look at the classes available in Android here: 
http://developer.android.com/reference/classes.html

So unfortunately you have to use other functions / classes 
to implement the same functionality.

PS: The class is shown in your screenshot 
because you browse the classes of java installed on your PC, 
not those that are be available on the Android phone / tablet.
