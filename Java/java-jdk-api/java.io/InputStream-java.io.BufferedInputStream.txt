Wraps an existing InputStream and buffers the input. Expensive interaction with the underlying input stream is minimized, since most (smaller) requests can be satisfied by accessing the buffer alone. The drawback is that some extra space is required to hold the buffer and that copying takes place when filling that buffer, but this is usually outweighed by the performance benefits.

A typical application pattern for the class looks like this:

 BufferedInputStream buf = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("file.java"));
