A data input stream lets an application 
read primitive Java data types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent way. 
An application uses a data output stream to write data that can later be read by a data input stream.

DataInputStream is not necessarily safe for multithreaded access. 
Thread safety is optional and is the responsibility of users of methods in this class.
