The base class for all readers. A reader is a means of reading data from a source in a character-wise manner. Some readers also support marking a position in the input and returning to this position later.

This abstract class does not provide a fully working implementation, so it needs to be subclassed, and at least the read(char[], int, int) and close() methods needs to be overridden. Overriding some of the non-abstract methods is also often advised, since it might result in higher efficiency.

Many specialized readers for purposes like reading from a file already exist in this package.
