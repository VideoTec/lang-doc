A specialized Reader that reads from a file in the file system. All read requests made by calling methods in this class are directly forwarded to the equivalent function of the underlying operating system. Since this may induce some performance penalty, in particular if many small read requests are made, a FileReader is often wrapped by a BufferedReader.
