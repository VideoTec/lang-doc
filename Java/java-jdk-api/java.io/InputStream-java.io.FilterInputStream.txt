说明：

Wraps an existing InputStream and performs some transformation on the input data while it is being read. 

Transformations can be anything from a simple byte-wise filtering input data to an on-the-fly compression or decompression of the underlying stream. 

Input streams that wrap another input stream and provide some additional functionality on top of it usually inherit from this class.
