What's the difference between getPath(), getAbsolutePath(), and getCanonicalPath() in Java?

Consider these filenames:

C:\temp\file.txt - This is a path, an absolute path, and a canonical path.

.\file.txt - This is a path. It's neither an absolute path nor a canonical path.

C:\temp\myapp\bin\..\\..\file.txt - This is a path and an absolute path. It's not a canonical path.

A canonical path is always an absolute path.

Converting from a path to a canonical path makes it absolute 
(usually tack on the current working directory so e.g. ./file.txt becomes c:/temp/file.txt). 

The canonical path of a file just "purifies" the path, 
removing and resolving stuff like ..\ and resolving symlinks (on unixes).
