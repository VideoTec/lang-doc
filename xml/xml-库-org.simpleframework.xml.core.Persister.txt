The Persister object is used to provide an implementation of a serializer. 
This implements the Serializer interface and enables objects to be persisted and 
loaded from various sources. 
This implementation makes use of Filter objects 
to replace template variables within the source XML document. 
It is fully thread safe and can be shared by multiple threads without concerns.

Deserialization is performed 
by passing an XML schema class into one of the read methods along with the source of an XML stream. 
The read method then reads the contents of the XML stream and 
builds the object using annotations within the XML schema class.

Serialization is performed by passing an object and an XML stream into one of the write methods. 
The serialization process will use the class of the provided object as the schema class. 
The object is traversed and all fields are marshalled to the result stream.
