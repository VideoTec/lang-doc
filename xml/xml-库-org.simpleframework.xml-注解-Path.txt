Constructor injection with nested path elements
In this example constructor injection is performed on two elements which also have Path annotations. As can be seen if there is no ambiguity there is no need to specify the path annotations on the constructor. This reduces the clutter that can occur with excessive annotations.

@Root
public class Point {

   @Path("a/b[1]")
   @Element
   private final int x;

   @Path("a/b[1]")
   @Element
   private final int y;

   public Point(@Element(name="x") int x, @Element(name="y") int y) {
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
   }
}
The below snippet shows an example of the resulting XML, both the x and y values will be injected in to the annotated constructor.
<point>
  <a>
    <b>
      <x>2</x>
      <y>7</y>
    </b>
  </a>
</point>
