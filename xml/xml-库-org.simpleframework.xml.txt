Simple is a high performance XML serialization and configuration framework for Java. 
Its goal is to provide an XML framework 
that enables rapid development of XML configuration and communication systems. 
This framework aids the development of XML systems with minimal effort and reduced errors. 
It offers full object serialization and deserialization, 
maintaining each reference encountered. 
In essence it is similar to C# XML serialization for the Java platform, 
but offers additional features for interception and manipulation.

This is an initial check in of code for the library hosted at http://simple.sourceforge.net. 
It contains quite a bit of rubbish, 
however the core is structured in a fairly standard manner 
where all source code and tests live under the src directory.
