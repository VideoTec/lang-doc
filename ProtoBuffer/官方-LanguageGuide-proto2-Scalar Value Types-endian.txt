Non-varint Numbers

Non-varint numeric types are simple â€“ double and fixed64 have wire type 1, 
which tells the parser to expect a fixed 64-bit lump of data; 
similarly float and fixed32 have wire type 5, 
which tells it to expect 32 bits. 
In both cases the values are stored in little-endian byte order.
