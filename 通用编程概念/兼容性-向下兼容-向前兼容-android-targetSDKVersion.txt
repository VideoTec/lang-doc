The most interesting of the three, however, is targetSdkVersion. targetSdkVersion is the main way Android provides forward compatibility by not applying behavior changes unless the targetSdkVersion is updated. 

You’ll be happy to know that forward compatibility is a strong focus of Android — existing apps built against prior SDKs should not break when the user updates to a new version of Android. This is where compileSdkVersion, minSdkVersion, and targetSdkVersion come in: they control what APIs are available, what the required API level is, and what compatiblity modes are applied, respectively.
