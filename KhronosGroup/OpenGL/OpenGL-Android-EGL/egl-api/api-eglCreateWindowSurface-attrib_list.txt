EGLSurface eglCreateWindowSurface(
EGLDisplay display,
EGLConfig config,               Specifies the EGL frame buffer configuration 
                                that defines the frame buffer resource available to the surface
NativeWindowType native_window,
EGLint const * attrib_list      May be NULL or empty (first attribute is EGL_NONE)
);

Surface attributes are specified as a list of attribute-value pairs, terminated with EGL_NONE. Accepted attributes are:

EGL_RENDER_BUFFER
Specifies which buffer should be used for client API rendering to the window. 
If its value is EGL_SINGLE_BUFFER, then client APIs should render directly into the visible window. 
If its value is EGL_BACK_BUFFER, then client APIs should render into the back buffer. 
The default value of EGL_RENDER_BUFFER is EGL_BACK_BUFFER.

Client APIs may not be able to respect the requested rendering buffer. 
To determine the actual buffer being rendered to by a context, call eglQueryContext.

EGL_VG_ALPHA_FORMAT
Specifies how alpha values are interpreted by OpenVG when rendering to the surface. 
If its value is EGL_VG_ALPHA_FORMAT_NONPRE, then alpha values are not premultipled. 
If its value is EGL_VG_ALPHA_FORMAT_PRE, then alpha values are premultiplied. 
The default value of EGL_VG_ALPHA_FORMAT is EGL_VG_ALPHA_FORMAT_NONPRE.

EGL_VG_COLORSPACE
Specifies the color space used by OpenVG when rendering to the surface. 
If its value is EGL_VG_COLORSPACE_sRGB, then a non-linear, perceptually uniform color space is assumed, 
with a corresponding VGImageFormat of form VG_s*. 
If its value is EGL_VG_COLORSPACE_LINEAR, then a linear color space is assumed, 
with a corresponding VGImageFormat of form VG_l*. 
The default value of EGL_VG_COLORSPACE is EGL_VG_COLORSPACE_sRGB.
