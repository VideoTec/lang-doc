The idea was to use the pbuffer 
as a texture, 
not as a render target. 
So you don't need the eglMakeCurrent call.

// create pbuffer
EGLint attribs[] = {
  EGL_WIDTH, width,
  EGL_HEIGHT, height,
  EGL_TEXTURE_FORMAT, EGL_TEXTURE_RGB,
  EGL_TEXTURE_TARGET, EGL_TEXTURE_2D,
  EGL_NONE
};
pbuffer = eglCreatePbufferSurface(eglDisplay, eglConfig, attribs);
 
// upload data to pbuffer
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0);
eglBindTexImage(eglDisplay, pbuffer, EGL_BACK_BUFFER);
glTexImage2D(...); 
 
// render using pbuffer as texture
