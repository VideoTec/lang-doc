attach an EGL rendering context to EGL surfaces

EGLBoolean eglMakeCurrent(
EGLDisplay display,
EGLSurface draw,      Specifies the EGL draw surface.
EGLSurface read,      Specifies the EGL read surface.
EGLContext context
);

重点一： draw 和 read 的区别

draw
draw is used for all GL operations（除了使用 read 之外的操作）

read
any pixel data read back (glReadPixels, glCopyTexImage2D, and glCopyTexSubImage2D), 
which is taken from the frame buffer values of read.

重点二：每个线程对应一个上下文 EGLContext

eglMakeCurrent binds context to the current rendering thread and to the draw and read surfaces.

If the calling thread has already a current rendering context, 
that context is flushed and marked as no longer current.

重点三：释放线程当前 EGLContext 时
To release the current context without assigning a new one, 
call eglMakeCurrent with draw and read set to EGL_NO_SURFACE and context set to EGL_NO_CONTEXT.

示例：eglMakeCurrent(display, EGL_NO_SURFACE, EGL_NO_SURFACE, EGL_NO_CONTEXT);

重点四：和 viewport and scissor dimensions 的关系
The first time that context is made current, 
the viewport and scissor dimensions are set to the size of the draw surface. 
The viewport and scissor are not modified when context is subsequently made current.
