Getting Attribute and Uniform Location
GLint glGetAttribLocation(GLuint program, const GLchar* name)

program: The program name/id generated by the glCreateProgram function.
name: The attribute's name inside the vertex shader.


GLint glGetUniformLocation(GLuint program, const GLchar* name)

program: The program name/id generated by the glCreateProgram function.
name: The uniform's name inside the shaders.

glGetAttribLocation/glGetUniformLocation returns 0

0 is a valid value, -1 is the "error" or "not found" value. The space for uniform locations and attrib locations is separate, so it's fine to have both a location 0 uniform and a location 0 attribute.

You should post the vertices and colors arrays to check if they have the right sizes, this is likely to cause a crash.
