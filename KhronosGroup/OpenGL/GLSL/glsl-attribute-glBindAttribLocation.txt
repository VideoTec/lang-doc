Setting Attribute Location before the linkage
GLvoid glBindAttribLocation(GLuint program, GLuint index, const GLchar* name)

program: The program name/id generated by the glCreateProgram function.
index: The location we want to set.
name: The name of attribute inside the vertex shader.

The above method must be called after you create the Program Object, 
but before you link it
