glUniform1i and glUniform1iv are the only two functions 
that may be used to load uniform variables defined as sampler types.

in order to change a uniform value, you must first bind the program to the context with glUseProgram​. 
The glUniform*​ functions do not take a program object name; 
they use the currently bound program.

glUniform doesn't work
You probably did not bind the correct shader first. Call glUseProgram(myprogram)​ first.
