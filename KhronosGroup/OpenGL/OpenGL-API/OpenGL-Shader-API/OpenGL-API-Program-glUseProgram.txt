install a program object as part of current rendering state

GLvoid glUseProgram(GLuint program)

After calling the function above, every subsequent call to glDraw* functions will
use the program which is currently in use. 

As any other glBind* function, 
the name/id 0 is reserved to OpenGL and 
if you call glUseProgram(0) this will unbind any current program

------------------------------------------
glUseProgram(0) 之后 出现未定义的行为
------------------------------------------
the current rendering state refers to an invalid program object, and 
the results of vertex and fragment shader execution due to any glDrawArrays or glDrawElements commands are undefined.

------------------------------------------
While a program object is in use
------------------------------------------
While a program object is in use, 
applications are free to 
modify attached shader objects, 
compile attached shader objects, a
ttach shader objects, and 
detach or delete shader objects. 
None of these operations will affect the executables that are part of the current state.
