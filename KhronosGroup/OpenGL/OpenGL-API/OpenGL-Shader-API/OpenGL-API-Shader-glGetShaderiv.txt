Name

glGetShaderiv — return a parameter from a shader object

C Specification

void glGetShaderiv(
GLuint shader,
GLenum pname,
GLint *params     返回值
);
 
Parameters

shader
Specifies the shader object to be queried.

pname
Specifies the object parameter. Accepted symbolic names are GL_SHADER_TYPE, GL_DELETE_STATUS, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LENGTH.

params
Returns the requested object parameter.

Description

glGetShaderiv returns in params the value of a parameter for a specific shader object. The following parameters are defined:

GL_SHADER_TYPE
params returns GL_VERTEX_SHADER if shader is a vertex shader object, and GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER if shader is a fragment shader object.

GL_DELETE_STATUS
params returns GL_TRUE if shader is currently flagged for deletion, and GL_FALSE otherwise.

GL_COMPILE_STATUS
For implementations that support a shader compiler, params returns GL_TRUE if the last compile operation on shader was successful, and GL_FALSE otherwise.

GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH
For implementations that support a shader compiler, params returns the number of characters in the information log for shader including the null termination character (i.e., the size of the character buffer required to store the information log). If shader has no information log, a value of 0 is returned.

GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LENGTH
For implementations that support a shader compiler, params returns the length of the concatenation of the source strings that make up the shader source for the shader, including the null termination character. (i.e., the size of the character buffer required to store the shader source). If no source code exists, 0 is returned.

Notes

Shader compiler support is optional, and thus must be queried before use by calling glGet with argument GL_SHADER_COMPILER. glShaderSource, glCompileShader, glGetShaderPrecisionFormat, and glReleaseShaderCompiler will each generate GL_INVALID_OPERATION on implementations that do not support a shader compiler, as will glGetShaderiv queries of GL_COMPILE_STATUS, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, and GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LENGTH. Such implementations instead offer the glShaderBinary alternative for supplying a pre-compiled shader binary.

If an error is generated, no change is made to the contents of params.
