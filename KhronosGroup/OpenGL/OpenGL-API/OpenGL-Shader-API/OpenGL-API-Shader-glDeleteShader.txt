Name

glDeleteShader â€” delete a shader object

C Specification

void glDeleteShader(GLuint shader);
 
Parameters

shader
Specifies the shader object to be deleted.

Description

glDeleteShader frees the memory and invalidates the name associated with the shader object specified by shader. This command effectively undoes the effects of a call to glCreateShader.

If a shader object to be deleted is attached to a program object, it will be flagged for deletion, but it will not be deleted until it is no longer attached to any program object, for any rendering context (i.e., it must be detached from wherever it was attached before it will be deleted). A value of 0 for shader will be silently ignored.

To determine whether an object has been flagged for deletion, call glGetShaderiv with arguments shader and GL_DELETE_STATUS.
