Name

glDeleteProgram â€” delete a program object

C Specification

void glDeleteProgram(GLuint program);
 
Parameters

program
Specifies the program object to be deleted.

Description

glDeleteProgram frees the memory and invalidates the name associated with the program object specified by program. This command effectively undoes the effects of a call to glCreateProgram.

If a program object is in use as part of current rendering state, it will be flagged for deletion, but it will not be deleted until it is no longer part of current state for any rendering context. If a program object to be deleted has shader objects attached to it, those shader objects will be automatically detached but not deleted unless they have already been flagged for deletion by a previous call to glDeleteShader. A value of 0 for program will be silently ignored.

To determine whether a program object has been flagged for deletion, call glGetProgramiv with arguments program and GL_DELETE_STATUS.
