Name

glGenBuffers â€” generate buffer object names

C Specification

void glGenBuffers(
GLsizei n,
GLuint * buffers
);
 
Parameters

n
Specifies the number of buffer object names to be generated.

buffers
Specifies an array in which the generated buffer object names are stored.

Description

glGenBuffers returns n buffer object names in buffers. There is no guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately before the call to glGenBuffers.

Buffer object names returned by a call to glGenBuffers are not returned by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with glDeleteBuffers.

No buffer objects are associated with the returned buffer object names until they are first bound by calling glBindBuffer.
