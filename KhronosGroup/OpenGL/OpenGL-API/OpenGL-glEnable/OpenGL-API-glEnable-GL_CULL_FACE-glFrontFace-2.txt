define front- and back-facing polygons

void glFrontFace(GLenum mode);

mode
Specifies the orientation of front-facing polygons. 
GL_CW and GL_CCW are accepted. 
The initial value is GL_CCW.

例子：
      gl.glFrontFace(GL10.GL_CCW);    // Front face in counter-clockwise orientation
      gl.glEnable(GL10.GL_CULL_FACE); // Enable cull face
      gl.glCullFace(GL10.GL_BACK);    // Cull the back face (don't display)

说明：
counterclockwise[英][ˌkaʊntəˈklɒkwaɪz] [美][ˌkaʊntərˈklɑ:kwaɪz]
adj.逆时针方向的，自右向左的

In a scene composed entirely of opaque closed surfaces, 
back-facing polygons are never visible. 
Eliminating these invisible polygons 
has the obvious benefit of speeding up the rendering of the image. 
To enable and disable elimination of back-facing polygons, 
call glEnable and glDisable with argument GL_CULL_FACE.

The projection of a polygon to window coordinates is said to 
have clockwise winding 
if an imaginary object following the path from its first vertex, 
its second vertex, and so on, to its last vertex, 
and finally back to its first vertex, 
moves in a clockwise direction about the interior of the polygon. 
The polygon's winding is said to be counterclockwise 
if the imaginary object following 
the same path moves in a counterclockwise direction 
about the interior of the polygon. 

glFrontFace specifies whether polygons with clockwise winding in window coordinates, 
or counterclockwise winding in window coordinates, are taken to be front-facing. 
Passing 
GL_CCW to mode selects counterclockwise polygons as front-facing; 
GL_CW selects clockwise polygons as front-facing. 
By default, counterclockwise polygons are taken to be front-facing.
