OpenGL ONLY accept POT （Power of Two）textures
That means all the textures must to have the width and height a power of two value。
Like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 or 1024 pixels.

The textures in OpenGL reads the pixels starting from the lower left corner and goes to the upper right corner

纹理单元
Texture Units represent a temporary link between the stored array of pixels and the actual render processing
by default any OpenGL implementation by vendors must supports up to 32 Texture Units
Well, OpenGL could hold on up to 32 Texture Units, which we'll use inside the shaders, but the shader just support up to 8
one Texture Unit can be used many times by multiple shaders pairs. 
We need a fast way to let the shaders get access the textures, like a bridge, or something temporary. 纹理单元担当这个角色
The user bind a texture data to a texture unit and instruct his shaders to use that unit

纹理时注意两点：
First, you must to activate the texture unit by using glActiveTexture() and then you bind the texture name/id using glBindTexture().

The second important thing is that even by default the OpenGL supports up to 32 texture units, you can't use a slot number higher than the maximum supported texture units in your vendor's implementation

"上传" 纹理数据，及设置纹理属性：
upload the texture data and set some properties
