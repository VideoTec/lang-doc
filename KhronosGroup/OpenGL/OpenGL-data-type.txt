 * The types in this file should only be used to define API-specific types.
 * Types defined in this file:
 *    khronos_int8_t              signed   8  bit
 *    khronos_uint8_t             unsigned 8  bit
 *    khronos_int16_t             signed   16 bit
 *    khronos_uint16_t            unsigned 16 bit
 *    khronos_int32_t             signed   32 bit
 *    khronos_uint32_t            unsigned 32 bit
 *    khronos_int64_t             signed   64 bit
 *    khronos_uint64_t            unsigned 64 bit
 *    khronos_intptr_t            signed   same number of bits as a pointer
 *    khronos_uintptr_t           unsigned same number of bits as a pointer
 *    khronos_ssize_t             signed   size
 *    khronos_usize_t             unsigned size
 *    khronos_float_t             signed   32 bit floating point
 *    khronos_time_ns_t           unsigned 64 bit time in nanoseconds
 *    khronos_utime_nanoseconds_t unsigned time interval or absolute time in
 *                                         nanoseconds
 *    khronos_stime_nanoseconds_t signed time interval in nanoseconds
 *
 * KHRONOS_SUPPORT_INT64 is 1 if 64 bit integers are supported; otherwise 0.
 * KHRONOS_SUPPORT_FLOAT is 1 if floats are supported; otherwise 0.
