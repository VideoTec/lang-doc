
OpenMAX DL is the interface between physical hardware, 
such as digital signal processor (DSP) chips and CPUs, and software, like video codecs and 3D engines. 
It allows companies to easily integrate[美][ˈɪntɪˌɡret]使整合 new hardware that supports OpenMAX DL 
without reoptimizing 重新优化 their low level software

OpenMAX DL is split into five application domains:
AC - Audio Codecs (MP3 decoder and AAC decoder components)
IC - Image Codecs (JPEG components)
IP - Image Processing (Generic image processing functions)
SP - Signal Processing (Generic audio processing functions)
VC - Video Codecs (H264 and MP4 components)

OpenMAX DL（Development Layer）定义了一套API，包含了
音频、视频和图像功能的函数集合，
这些函数需要由芯片厂商针对处理器特性进行实现和优化，
然后被编解码器厂商在各种编解码器上使用
