Running documentation locally

Run through the tooling setup to install Jekyll (the site builder) 
and other Ruby dependencies with bundle install.

Run grunt (or a specific set of Grunt tasks) 
to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.

From the root /bootstrap directory, 
run bundle exec jekyll serve in the command line.

Open http://localhost:9001 in your browser, and voilà.
Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its documentation.
