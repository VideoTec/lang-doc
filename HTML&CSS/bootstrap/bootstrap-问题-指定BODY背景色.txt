You need to either add this:

html { background: transparent }
Or, set the "page background" (background: black) on html instead, which is fine to do.

Why? Inside Bootstrap, there's this:

html,body{background-color:#ffffff;}
(bear in mind the default background value is transparent)

For more information on why this matters, see: What is the difference between applying css rules to html compared to body?

Note that this is no longer an issue with Bootstrap 3+.
