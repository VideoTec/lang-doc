HTML <a> name Attribute
<a name="value">

The <a> name attribute is not supported in HTML5. 
Use the id attribute instead.

The name attribute specifies the name of an anchor.
The name attribute is used to create a bookmark inside a document.

<h1><a name="foo"/>Foo Title</h1>
<h1 id="foo">Foo Title</h1>
They both work, but are they equal, or do they have semantic differences?

For HTML documents (and the text/html MIME type), 
the following processing model must be followed 
to determine what the indicated part of the document is.

1）Parse the URL, and let fragid be the <fragment> component of the URL.

2）If fragid is the empty string, 
then the indicated part of the document is the top of the document.

3）If there is an element in the DOM that has an ID exactly equal to fragid, 
then the first such element in tree order is the indicated part of the document; 
stop the algorithm here.

4）If there is an a element in the DOM 
that has a name attribute whose value is exactly equal to fragid, 
then the first such element in tree order is the indicated part of the document; 
stop the algorithm here.

5）Otherwise, there is no indicated part of the document.

If parsed URL’s fragment component is not null, 
then first append a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#) to script source, 
and then append parsed URL’s fragment component to script source.

Return "#", followed by this Location object’s URL’s fragment.

Returns the Location object’s URL’s fragment (includes leading "#" if non-empty). 
Can be set, 
to navigate to the same URL with a changed fragment (ignores leading "#").
