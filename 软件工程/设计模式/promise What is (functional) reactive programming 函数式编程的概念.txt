To me it is about 2 different meanings of symbol =:

1）
In math x = sin(t) means, that x is different name for sin(t). 
So writing x + y is the same thing as sin(t) + y. 
Functional reactive programming is like math in this respect: 
if you write x + y, 
it is computed with whatever the value of t is at the time it's used.

2）
In C-like programming languages (imperative languages), 
x = sin(t) is an assignment: 
it means that x stores the value of sin(t) taken 
at the time of the assignment.
