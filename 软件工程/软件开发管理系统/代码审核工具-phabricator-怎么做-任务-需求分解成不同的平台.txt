子任务的概念

I accomplish this by going to the parent task and then "Edit Blocking Tasks."

elationships in Phabricator are expressed by edges. 
Subtasks or blocking tasks are UI words 
to convey the presence of such an edge between two tasks.

Allow a task to be assigned to multiple people
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We don't plan to support this. 
There are various technical/product/priority reasons, 
but philosophically I think it's important that ownership be unambiguous. 
I'm also not aware of any task systems which support this.

Among other tasks systems, JIRA also doesn't support this, and suggests some workarounds here:

https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/How+do+I+assign+issues+to+multiple+users

Including reasonable approaches like:

1) Split the task into multiple subtasks, 
each describing the work an individual is responsible for.

2) And creative approaches like:
Create a shared user account that both users have the password for.

3/4 of JIRA's workarounds are really about group ownership, 
although it sounds like that isn't your use case.

For these "group ownership" use cases, 
things like shared queues may be available in Phabricator after Nuance. 
We might let tasks be owned by projects eventually
