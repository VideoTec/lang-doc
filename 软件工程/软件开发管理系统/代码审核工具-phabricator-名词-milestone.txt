Milestones
Milestones are simple subprojects for tracking sprints, iterations, versions, or other similar blocks of work. Milestones make it easier to create and manage a large number of similar subprojects (for example: Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Sprint 3, etc).

Milestones can not have direct members or policies. Instead, the membership and policies of a milestones are always the same as the milestone's parent project. This makes large numbers of milestones more manageable when changes occur.

Milestones can not have subprojects, and can not have their own milestones.

By default, Milestones do not have their own hashtags.

Milestones can have normal workboards.

Objects may not be tagged with two different milestones of the same parent project. For example, a task may not be tagged with both Stonework → Iteration III and Stonework → Iteration V.

When a milestone tag is added to an object which already has a tag from the same series of milestones, the old tag is removed. For example, adding the Stonework → Iteration V tag to a task which already has the Stonework → Iteration III tag will remove the Iteration III tag.

This restriction does not apply to milestones which are not part of the same series. For example, a task may be tagged with both Stonework → Iteration V and Heraldry → Iteration IX.
