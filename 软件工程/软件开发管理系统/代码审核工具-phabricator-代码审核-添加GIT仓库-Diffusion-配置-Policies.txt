The Policies section of the management interface 
allows you to review and manage repository access policies.

You can configure granular access policies for each repository to control 
who can view, clone, administate, and push to the repository.

Policies: View

Policies: Edit

Policies: Push
This policy has no effect if Phabricator is not hosting the repository, 
because it can not control 
who is allowed to make changes to a remote repository it is merely observing.
