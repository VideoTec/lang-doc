Typical uses of workboards[edit]

Workflow
Typical columns would be along the lines of TODO, DOING, DONE
This supports both Scrum-style sprint iterations, and Kanban-style continuous work

Roadmap
Each column might represent a target release, or general timeframe (e.g. "2016")

Categories
Columns might group Tasks by component, functional area, or even complexity
