第一种方法：
Linking to Objects
You can link to Phabricator objects, such as 
Differential revisions, 
Diffusion commits and 
Maniphest tasks, by mentioning the name of an object:

D123          # Link to Differential revision D123
rX123         # Link to SVN commit 123 from the "X" repository
rXaf3192cd5   # Link to Git commit "af3192cd5..." from the "X" repository.
              # You must specify at least 7 characters of the hash.
T123          # Link to Maniphest task T123
You can also link directly to a comment in Maniphest and Differential:

T123#4        # Link to comment #4 of T123

See the Phabricator configuraton setting remarkup.ignored-object-names to modify this behavior.

第二种方法：
Embedding Objects
You can also generate full-name references to some objects by using braces:

{D123}        # Link to Differential revision D123 with the full name
{T123}        # Link to Maniphest task T123 with the full name
These references will also show when an object changes state 
(for instance, a task or revision is closed). Some types of objects support rich embedding.
