Staging Area
The Staging Area panel configures staging areas, 
used to make proposed changes available to build and continuous integration systems.

For more details, see Harbormaster User Guide.

详细说明：
To make it easier to run integration tests and builds on code under review, 
you can configure a Staging Area. 
When arc creates a diff, 
it will push a copy of the changes to the configured staging area with a corresponding tag.
